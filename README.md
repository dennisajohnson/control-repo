## Puppet Agent Installs


### RedHat Agent

1. Set the host/DNS name of the server
    * sudo nano /etc/hosts
    * 127.0.0.1 hostname hostname.example.local
    * 192.168.0.10 hostname hostname.example.local
    * hostnamectl set-hostname hostname.example.local
1. Install RedHat Agent
    * sudo yum install puppet-agent
    * puppet config set server puppetserver.example.com --section main
    * puppet agent --test
    * Login to PE console > Certificates and approve the certificate
           
1. After GitLab is installed you may sign in with the `root` user. If you didn't specify a custom password during installation, a temporary password is located in `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password`.
1. Make a user for yourself.
1. Make an SSH key to link with your user. Youâ€™ll want to do this on the machine you intend to edit code from (most likely not your Puppet master, but your local workstation or laptop).

    * <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>
1. Create a group called `puppet` (this is case sensitive).
    * <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html>
1. Add your user to the `puppet` group as well.
1. Create a project called `control-repo`, and set the Namespace to be the `puppet` group.
1. Clone this control repository to your laptop/workstation:
    * `git clone <repository url>`
    * `cd control-repo`
1. Remove this repository as the origin remote:
    * `git remote remove origin`
1. Add your internal repository as the origin remote:
    * `git remote add origin <url of your gitlab repository>`
1. Push the production branch of the repository from your machine up to your git server
    * `git push origin production`

### Bitbucket/Stash

1. Install Bitbucket
    * <https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download>
1. Make a `Project` called `puppet` (with a short name of `PUP`)
1. Create a repository called `control-repo`
1. Create a user called `r10k` with a password of `puppet`.
    * Make the r10k user an admin of the `PUP` project.
1. Either use the admin user to test pushing code, or create a user for yourself and add your SSH key to that user.
    * If making a user for yourself, give your user account read/write or admin privilege to the `PUP` project.
1. Clone this control repository to your laptop/workstation
    * `git clone <repository url>`
    * `cd control-repo`
1. Remove this repository as the origin remote
    * `git remote remove origin`
1. Add your internal repository as the origin remote
    * `git remote add origin <url of your bitbucket repository>`
1. Push the production branch of the repository from your machine up to your git server
    * `git push origin production`

### GitHub

Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create your control repository starting from this template.

### GitHub Enterprise

1. Prepare your local git client to authenticate with a **local GitHub Enterprise instance**.

    * <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/>
1. Create a repository called `control-repo` in your user account or organization. Ensure that "Initialize this repository with a README" is not selected.
    * <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/>
1. Make a note of your repository URL (HTTPS or SSH, depending on your security configuration).
1. Clone this control repository to your laptop/workstation:
    * `git clone <repository url>`
    * `cd control-repo`
1. Remove this repository as the origin remote:
    * `git remote remove origin`
1. Add your internal repository as the origin remote:
    * `git remote add origin <url of your github repository>`
1. Push the production branch of the repository from your machine up to your git server
    * `git push origin production`

## Code Manager Setup

If you use Puppet Enterprise see the official [documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/code_mgr.html) for enabling Code Manager.
